# Community Guidelines

maton.net is a part of TheFlightSims. We provide multimedia and metaverse internally.

This repo was copied from TheFlightSims/.github 

That means, the documents are shared between the TheFlightSims and sub-organization.

Note that some different still can be seen here. It's because of the diiferent of industrial, and customers behaviour range.

At maton.net, we recognize and celebrate the creativity and collaboration of open-source contributors and the diversity of skills, experiences, cultures, and opinions they bring to the projects and communities they participate in.

Every one of the communities is an inclusive environment based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or similar personal characteristics.

We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more.

Respectful behavior includes:

* Being considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Not engaging in demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* Not engaging in unwanted physical contact.

Some maton.net open-source projects may adopt an explicit project code of conduct, which may have additional detailed expectations for participants. Most of those projects will use our modified Contributor Covenant.

## Resolve peacefully

We do not believe all conflict is destructive; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

## Reporting problems

Some maton.net open-source projects may adopt a project-specific code of conduct. In those cases, a maton.net employee will be identified as the Project Steward, who will receive and handle code of conduct violation reports. If a project hasnâ€™t identified a Project Steward, you can report problems by emailing [this email](theflightsims@gmail.com).

We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response.

We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, ranging from not taking action to permanent expulsion from
the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the report and allow them to discuss it before taking action. The reporter's identity will be omitted from the report's details supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without notice.
