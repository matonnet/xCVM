## Contributors

## Status

Complete

## Dependencies

Written against the glTF 2.0 spec.

### Interaction with `KHR_materials_unlit`

If the material has both `VRMC_materials_mtoon` and `KHR_materials_unlit`, `VRMC_materials_mtoon` takes precedence.

If it is difficult to implement MToon shader, it MAY fallback to `KHR_materials_unlit`.

## Overview

This extension defines a material with toon shading for VRM models.

The objective is to coordinate with scenes with PBR shading while adding toon effects.
It does not specialize in Japanese hand-drawn animation-like expressions.

Toon shading, in general, usually takes the image-processing approach, while this specification approximates toon-like looking, avoiding image-processing.
Therefore, this definition includes definitions that depend on specific rendering techniques.

## Extending Materials

MToon materials are defined by adding the `VRMC_materials_mtoon` extension to material definitions.

```json
{
    "materials": [
        {
            "name": "MyUnlitMaterial",
            "pbrMetallicRoughness": {
                "baseColorFactor": [ 0.5, 0.8, 0.0, 1.0 ]
                // texture
            },
            // emission

            "extensions": {
                "VRMC_materials_mtoon": {
                    "specVersion": "1.0",
                    // ...
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Definition

### Types

Colors and textures are stored in linear colorspace as glTF core specification specifies unless it's explicitly specified.

### Vertex Colors

In MToon, vertex colors are ignored.

### Meta

This section specifies about meta information of the extension.

#### MToon Defined Properties

|             | Type     | Description              | Required |
|-------------|----------|--------------------------|:---------|
| specVersion | `string` | Version of the extension | ✅ Yes    |

#### specVersion ✅

Indicates the version number of the extension.
The value is `"1.0"`.

- Type: `string`
- Required: Yes

### Rendering

This section specifies the rendering of MToon materials.

#### Render Mode

Render Mode specifies how this material will be rendered with alpha processing.
The alpha value refers to the alpha value defined by `pbrMetallicRoughness.baseColorFactor` and `pbrMetallicRoughness.baseColorTexture` defined in the glTF core specification.
`alphaMode` and `alphaCutoff` defined in the glTF core specification define how to deal with the alpha value.
The details of each alpha mode conform to the glTF specification.

In addition to the `alphaMode` defined in the glTF, this extension defines the property `transparentWithZWrite`.
It is usually not recommended to write to the depth buffer when `alphaMode` is `BLEND`.
When `transparentWithZWrite` is set to `true`, it is recommended to write to the depth buffer even when `alphaMode` is `BLEND`.

> The implementation may fallback to ordinary alpha blending if it is difficult to implement the `transparentWithZWrite` or equivalent behavior.

#### Render Queue

Render Queue specifies in what order MToon materials should be drawn.
MToon expects the following order of rendering:

1. `alphaMode` is `OPAQUE`
2. `alphaMode` is `MASK`
3. `alphaMode` is `BLEND` and `transparentWithZWrite` is `true`
4. `alphaMode` is `BLEND` and `transparentWithZWrite` is `false`

Since transparency is often used in toon shaders, problems due to the rendering order often happen.
MToon introduces not only `transparentWithZWrite` but also another property `renderQueueOffsetNumber` for this reason.
`renderQueueOffsetNumber` specifies the offset value to each rendering order.
It is intended to be an offset value of the Render Queue value in Unity.
`renderQueueOffsetNumber` only works when `alphaMode` is `BLEND`.
The higher the value, the later the drawing order.

The following table shows the possible ranges of values.

|                                                               | Min Value | Max Value |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------|:----------|:----------|
| `alphaMode` is `OPAQUE`                                       | `0`       | `0`       |
| `alphaMode` is `MASK`                                         | `0`       | `0`       |
| `alphaMode` is `BLEND` and `transparentWithZWrite` is `true`  | `0`       | `+9`      |
| `alphaMode` is `BLEND` and `transparentWithZWrite` is `false` | `-9`      | `0`       |

The order specified by `alphaMode` is prioritized regardless of `renderQueueOffsetNumbers`.

When rendering non-MToon models such as other glTF models together, assume that their `renderQueueOffsetNumber` is `0`.

The implementation may assume `renderQueueOffsetNumber` as 0 as a fallback if it is difficult to implement the `renderQueueOffsetNumber` or equivalent behavior.

#### transparentWithZWrite

The value specifies whether write to depth buffer or not when `alphaMode` is `BLEND`.

- Type: `boolean`
- Required: No, default: `false`

#### renderQueueOffsetNumber

An offset value to the rendering order.

- Type: `integer`
- Required: No, default: `0`

#### Double Sided

Mesh culling follows the specification of the `doubleSided` property of the glTF core specification.

However, front-face culling is always used for drawing outlines which is defined in this extension (See [Outline](#Outline)) regardless of the `doubleSided` value.

### Lighting

This section specifies the lighting of MToon materials.

#### Lighting Model

MToon extends the Lambert reflection model.
While surface normals and light vectors are used for shading as the normal Lambert reflection model does, MToon has the following features to enable toon expression:

- Apart from the base color, a shade color can be specified.
- The shade boundary's position and width (feather) can be adjusted.

#### Lit Color

Base color is determined by `pbrMetallicRoughness.baseColorFactor` and `pbrMetallicRoughness.baseColorTexture` which are defined in the glTF core specification.

#### Shade Color

MToon specifies a shade color in addition to the base color.

While the typical Lambert reflection model renders unlit surfaces in black,
MToon interpolates between the base and shade colors depending on how lit the surface is.
Also, just like how the `baseColorTexture` interacts with the `baseColorFactor`, a different texture can be specified for the shade color, and the texture color multiplies the shade color factor.

The shade color uses two properties, `shadeColorFactor` and `shadeMultiplyTexture`, defined by the MToon extension.

<img src="figures/mtoon-lit-shade.png" width="67%">

#### Surface Normal

MToon can use normal textures.
MToon uses `normalTexture` defined in the glTF core specification.

#### Shading Shift

MToon linearly interpolates base and shade colors according to the dot product of the surface normal and the light vector.
MToon can adjust the threshold position and width (feather) of the boundary between the lit and unlit parts.

The position of the shading boundary is specified by the `shadingShiftFactor` and `shadingShiftTexture` defined by the MToon extension.
The width of the shading boundary is specified by the `shadingToonyFactor` defined by the MToon extension.

`shadingShiftTexture` adjusts the position of the shading boundary set by `shadingShiftFactor`.
This texture allows it to adjust the lighting on certain model parts.
The value of `shadingShiftTexture` adds the `shadingShiftFactor` value.
`shadingShiftTexture.scale` controls how much this texture contributes to the shading boundary.

<img src="figures/mtoon-shading-ramp.png" width="67%">

#### Implementation

The pseudocode represents the implementation example of the lighting procedure:

```
function linearstep( a: Number, b: Number, t: Number ): Number
  return saturate( ( t - a ) / ( b - a ) )
end function

let shading: Number = dot( N, L )
shading = shading + shadingShiftFactor
shading = shading + texture( shadingShiftTexture, uv ) * shadingShiftTexture.scale
shading = linearstep( -1.0 + shadingToonyFactor, 1.0 - shadingToonyFactor, shading )

let baseColorTerm: ColorRGB = baseColorFactor.rgb * texture( baseColorTexture, uv ).rgb
let shadeColorTerm: ColorRGB = shadeColorFactor.rgb * texture( shadeMultiplyTexture, uv ).rgb

let color: ColorRGB = lerp( baseColorTerm, shadeColorTerm, shading )
color = color * lightColor
```

### Global Illumination

This section defines the behavior for global illumination, such as IBL (Image-based Lighting) and SH (Spherical Harmonics), which do not depend on a specific position or orientation.

In general, toon shaders shouldn't express detailed shadings which can able to show details of geometries.
For this reason, this extension introduces the parameters Shading Toony and Shading Shift.
These parameters allow the shading to be mildly changing in response to normal directions and incident light sources.

However, for global illumination, such as IBL and SH Lighting, these parameters are not sufficient.
Global illumination also changes the radiance significantly with changes in direction.

Therefore, this extension introduces the GI Equalization Factor parameter.
The GI Equalization Factor allows the geometry to have constant global illumination independent of the geometry's face direction.
As a result, the resulting shading under global illuminations is weaker and the geometry's detail becomes milder.
Specifically, this is achieved by smoothing the global illumination factor depending on the direction.

The GI Equalization Factor uses the `giEqualizationFactor` defined by the MToon extension.

The detailed calculation definition is given below.

First, let `n` be the normal vector of a geometry.
Let `rawGi(x)` be a function that finds the global illumination on the rendering system corresponding to a direction vector `x`.
Then define the uniformed global illumination `uniformedGi`.
Ideally, `uniformedGi` is required to compute the average value using integration in all directions.
However, since it is too demanding for real-time rendering, an approximate implementation should be used in each implementation.
For example, an implementation that handles only the low-order terms of Spherical Harmonics.
However, if only the low-order terms of the Spherical Harmonics are used, it may not approximate well under strong parallel light sources (e.g., sunlight).
Here is an example of an implementation that approximates the average of a two-point sampling.

`uniformedGi = (rawGi([0, 1, 0]) + rawGi([0, -1, 0])) / 2`.

The global illumination `gi(n)` corresponding to the normal vector `n` of any geometry is then calculated as follows

`gi(n) = lerp(rawGi(n), uniformedGi, giEqualization)`

Then, Lit Color is considered the diffuse factor and the following lighting calculation is performed.

`giLighting = gi(n) * litColor`

#### Implementation

The pseudocode represents the implementation example of the global illumination procedure:

```
let giEqualizationFactor: number

let worldUpVector: Vector3 = Vector3(0, +1, 0)
let worldDownVector: Vector3 = Vector3(0, -1, 0)

let uniformedGi: ColorRGB = (rawGi(worldUpVector) + rawGi(worldDownVector)) / 2.0
let passthroughGi: ColorRGB = rawGi(normal)

let gi: ColorRGB = lerp(passthroughGi, uniformedGi, giEqualizationFactor)

-- color already has the direct lighting factor
color = color + gi * litColor
```

#### MToon Defined Properties

|                      | Type     | Description                                        | Required           |
|:---------------------|:---------|:---------------------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| giEqualizationFactor | `number` | The equalization factor of the global illumination | No, Default: `0.9` |

#### giEqualizationFactor

Defines the equalization factor of the global illumination.
When the value is `0`, global illumination is calculated as usual.
The closer the value is to `1`, the more the global illumination is smoothed and eventually be in uniform depending on the direction of the surface.

See the section [Global Illumination](#Global%20Illumination) for specific details of the global illumination procedure.

- Type: `number`
- Required: No, default: `0.9`

### Emission

Emission can be defined.
`emissiveFactor` and `emissiveTexture` defined in the core specification of glTF will be used.

### Rim Lighting

This section specifies the rim lighting of MToon materials.

#### MatCap

MacCap is a texture mapping method that uses the view-space normal vector.
It is widely used for baking lighting.
The result of matcap is additive blended to the lighting result.

The matcap texture is stored in `matcapTexture` defined by the MToon extension.
The result is multiplied by the factor `matcapFactor` also defined by the MToon extension.

#### Parametric Rim Lighting

Parametric rim lighting is a method of creating a pseudo rim lighting effect on the edges of an object using the view-space normal vector.
The parametric rim light is additive blended to the lighting result.

The color of the parametric rim lighting is stored in `parametricRimColorFactor` defined by the MToon extension.

The shape of parametric rim lighting is controlled by values `parametricRimFresnelPowerFactor` and `parametricRimLiftFactor` defined by the MToon extension.
The shape is obtained by the formula `pow( saturate( 1.0 - dot( N, V ) + parametricRimLiftFactor ), parametricRimFresnelPowerFactor )`.

> The expression maybe results in NaN if given `parametricRimFresnelPowerFactor` is zero.
> The implementation should avoid NaN depending on the environment.
> ex. `parametricRimFresnelPowerFactor = max(parametricRimFresnelPowerFactor, epsilon)`

#### Rim Multiply Texture

It is possible to mask the rim lighting using a mask texture.
The value of the mask texture multiplies to the rim lighting result.

The mask texture is stored in `rimMultiplyTexture` defined by the MToon extension.

#### Rim Lighting Mix

It is possible to control how much the rim lighting is affected by the surrounding lighting.
When it is not affected, the rim lighting behaves like an emission.
When it is affected, the influence of the surrounding lighting multiplies to the rim lighting result.

The influence of the light source is controlled linearly by the value `rimLightingMixFactor` defined by the MToon extension.

#### Implementation

The pseudocode represents the implementation example of the rim lighting procedure:

```
let rim: ColorRGB

let worldViewX: Vector3 = normalize( Vector3( V.z, 0.0, -V.x ) )
let worldViewY: Vector3 = cross( V, x )

let matcapUv: Vector2 = Vector2( dot( x, N ), dot( y, N ) ) * 0.495 + 0.5

let epsilon: Number = 0.00001;

rim = matcapFactor * texture( matcapTexture, matcapUv ).rgb

let parametricRim: Number = saturate( 1.0 - dot( N, V ) + parametricRimLiftFactor )
parametricRim = pow( parametricRim, max( parametricRimFresnelPowerFactor, epsilon ) )

rim = rim + parametricRim * parametricRimColorFactor

rim = rim * texture( rimMultiplyTexture, uv ).rgb

rim = rim * lerp( ColorRGB( 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ), lighting, rimLightingMixFactor )

-- color already has the direct lighting factor + global illumination factor
color = color + rim
```

The outline width is calculated using values `outlineWidthMode`, `outlineWidthFactor`, `outlineWidthTexture` defined by the MToon extension.

If the `outlineWidthMode` is `"none"`, the outline is not rendered.
If the `outlineWidthMode` is `"worldCoordinates"`, the width of the outline is determined by the distance in the world coordinate system.
If the `outlineWidthMode` is `"screenCoordinates"`, the width of the outline depends on the screen coordinate system, which results in the thickness of the outline being constant regardless of the world space distance to the mesh.

The unit of `outlineWidthFactor` is meters when the `outlineWidthMode` is `"worldCoordinates"`, or a ratio to the screen height when the `outlineWidthMode` is `"screenCoordinates"`.

The texture `outlineWidthTexture` adjusts the outline width in certain parts.
The texture will be UV mapped and the value multiplies to the outline width.
It is intended to be used for masking outlines where you do not want to outline certain parts of the mesh.

> In general, it is recommended to render outlines in the width that artists desire by respecting `outlineWidthMode` and `outlineWidthFactor`.
> However, applications might want to render outlines in the preferred outline width only when the model is close enough to the camera and render thinner as the camera goes away from the model (the behavior of `OutlineScaledMaxDistance` in VRM0).
> The actual line width should be set properly depending on application demands.

#### Outline Lighting Mix

The outline color can be affected by the surface shading results.
The result of [Lighting](#lighting), [Global Illumination](#global-illumination), [Emission](#emission), and [Rim Lighting](#rim-lighting) described above are multiplied against the outline color.
It is possible to linearly interpolate between unlit and lit results using the value `outlineLightingMixFactor` defined by the MToon extension.

#### Implementation

Rasterizer-based renderer usually draws outlines in a separated pass from the mesh surface pass.
Outline vertices are calculated using vertices after skinning is done.
The vertex information includes positions and normals after transforms.

> If it is difficult or performance-heavy to implement multi-pass rendering of meshes, fallback to omit rendering outlines.

#### outlineWidthMode

The rendering mode of outlines.

See the section [Outline](#Outline) for specific details of the outline rendering procedure.

- Type: `string`
- Required: No, default: `"none"`
- Allowed values:
  - `"none"`
  - `"worldCoordinates"`
  - `"screenCoordinates"`

#### outlineWidthFactor

The width factor of outlines.

See the section [Outline](#Outline) for specific details of the outline rendering procedure.

- Type: `number`
- Required: No, default: `0.0`

#### outlineWidthMultiplyTexture

The texture to set multiplication factor of outline width.
If it is not assigned, the value of `outlineWidthFactor` is used directly.

The components of the texture are stored in linear colorspace.
The G component of the texture is referred to.

> You can use either a monochrome mask texture or an RGB texture with other masks per channel since the property references the G component of the assigned texture.
> You can combine `shadingShiftTexture` (which uses the R channel) and `uvAnimationMaskTexture` (which uses the B channel) into a single texture.

- Type: `object`
- Required: No

#### outlineColorFactor

The color of the outline.
The value is evaluated in linear colorspace.

- Type: `number[3]`
- Required: No, default: `[0, 0, 0]`

#### outlineLightingMixFactor

The factor specifies the ratio of how much the outline color is multiplied by the surface shading result.
If the value is set to `0.0`, the outline is rendered in the color specified by `outlineColorFactor` directly.
If you want the outline color to be affected by the lighting, set the value to `1.0`.

- Type: `number`
- Required: No, default: `1.0`

### UV Animation

It is possible to animate textures using UV animation.
The animation is automatic and perpetual, not controllable.

When transforming UV by the animation, values for each UV component are not clamped or repeated and the range of possible values can be outside of [0.0 - 1.0].
The specification assumes that the texture's `wrapS` or `wrapT` are set to `REPEAT` or `MIRRORED_REPEAT` .

These textures defined in the MToon extension are affected by the UV animation:

- `shadeMultiplyTexture`
- `shadingToonyMultiplyTexture`
- `rimMultiplyTexture`
- `outlineWidthMultiplyTexture`

These textures defined in the core specification of glTF are also affected by the UV animation:

- `pbrMetallicRoughness.baseColorTexture`
- `emissiveTexture`
- `normalTexture`

> `matcapTexture` , which is mapped using view-space normal vector, is not affected by the UV animation.

> Implementation Note: We don't specify about textures which is defined outside the MToon extension or glTF core specification. Each implementation might support animation of these textures if necessary.

#### UV Scroll

The speed of the UV scroll will be set by `uvAnimationScrollXSpeedFactor` and `uvAnimationScrollYSpeedFactor` .

The unit is the UV coordinate unit per second. When the value is `1.0` , UV will scroll by 1 for each second.
The scroll direction is in which the UV value increases positively when the value is positive.

#### UV Rotation

The speed of the UV rotation will be set by `uvAnimationRotationSpeedFactor` .

The unit is radian per second. When the value is `1.0` , UV will turn once for each 2π seconds.
The UV rotates around (0.5, 0.5) in the UV coordinate.
The rotation direction is in which rotates UV coordinates counter-clockwise (in U-right, V-down space).

> The rotation direction is same as [KHR_texture_transform](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_transform).
> See also the sample model "[VRMC_materials_mtoon UV Animation Test](../../samples/VRMC_materials_mtoon_UV_Animation_Test/)".

#### Transform Order

The mathematical notation shows the application order of UV animations using homogeneous coordinates.

Let ${\rm scrollX}$ be the scroll in X axis by the `uvAnimationScrollXSpeedFactor` ,
${\rm scrollY}$ be the scroll in Y axis by the `uvAnimationScrollYSpeedFactor` ,
${\rm rotation}$ be the rotation animation by the `uvAnimationRotationSpeedFactor` ,

The animated UV will be:

```math
\begin{pmatrix} {\rm uv}'.x \\ {\rm uv}'.y \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & {\rm scrollX} \\ 0 & 1 & {\rm scrollY} \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0.5 \\ 0 & 1 & 0.5 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \cos({\rm rotation}) & \sin({\rm rotation}) & 0 \\ -\sin({\rm rotation}) & \cos({\rm rotation}) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -0.5 \\ 0 & 1 & -0.5 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} {\rm uv}.x \\ {\rm uv}.y \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
```

> When the scroll and the rotation are set at the same time, the animation speed should not accelerate over time.

#### UV Animation Mask Texture

The mask texture of the UV animations will be set by `uvAnimationMaskTexture` .

The value multiplies to UV animation speed set by `uvAnimationScrollXSpeedFactor` , `uvAnimationScrollYSpeedFactor` , `uvAnimationRotationSpeedFactor` .
If it's not assigned, each factor value is used directly.

#### Implementation

The pseudocode represents the implementation example of the UV animation:

```
// note that the matrix is defined in column-major
let rotationCos: float = cos( rotation * uvAnimMask );
let rotationSin: float = sin( rotation * uvAnimMask );
uv = mat2(
  rotationCos, rotationSin,
  -rotationSin, rotationCos
) * ( uv - 0.5 ) + 0.5;

uv = uv + vec2( scrollX, scrollY ) * uvAnimMask;
```

#### Compatibility with KHR_texture_transform

If `KHR_texture_transform` is used, the texture transform of the UV animation is performed before the transform of `KHR_texture_transform` .

> Even when using `KHR_texture_transform` , values of each UV component are not modified by clamp or repeat and the range of possible vlaues can be outside of [0.0 - 1.0] .
